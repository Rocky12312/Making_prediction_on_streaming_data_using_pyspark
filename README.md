# Making_prediction_on_streamong_data_using_pyspark

Basically for checking the prediction on the streaming data run the program(open the terminal and write "python3 filename localhost portnumber" in one terminal and use Netcat in another terminal(a tool which can be used to send data to the defined hostname and port number).You can start the TCP connection using this command(nc -lk portnumber)specify the port number at place of port number.
Give the data and check the predictions on the streaming data.
